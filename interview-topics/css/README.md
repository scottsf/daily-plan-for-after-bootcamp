## Inline, inline-block and block elements
  Inline element: It only accepts margin right and left. It won't accept any box models.
  Inline-block element: It allows other elements to sit around it and accept box models. 
  Block element: It behaves like the inline-block element, but it takes all the width of the parent element.
