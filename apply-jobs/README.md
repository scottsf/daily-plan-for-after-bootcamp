## Group the companies that you want to work 

First let's make a list of companies you want to work for and group them in A, B, C. Write down the most wanted
companies in the group A. For example: FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) will go the this group. Put the
avarage companies in the group B. The least desired companies will go to the group C. 

Start submitting your applications from the group C. Because you need interview experiences due to prepare
yourself for your most wanted companies. It will help you to find your weak areas and mistakes. You will improve them along the way. 

## Create you accounts

## How many applications to submit per day?

Writing a good *Cover Letter*  and editing your *Resume* takes time. So submit no more or less than 5 companies per
day. I will explain it end of this paragraph. By the way, I'm not counting here LinkedIn Easy Apply feature because It allows users to submit as many applications as possible with one-click. 

## Does Cover Letter matters? 

Countless times I met with HR managers from big FAANGS and Startups at Meetups in San Francisco. 80% of them mentioned that they don't read the Cover Letters. However, rest of 20% who reads them may give the chance for a candidate to get an invitation for the interview even though he/she is not qualified. It won't help if you are just using a template for your Cover Letter and changing a Company name and job title. Due to get an attention, your Cover Letter must be outstanding. You have to explain that what makes you interested in apply for this specific role and what can you bring to the table. You can read more about it [here](https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/11/11/developer-cover-letter/) 
Personally, I prefer to submit my Resume attach with my Cover Letter.

## The best time to apply and how much time you need to spend
It matters when you send your application. The best time is between 6am - 10am every week days. It will increase your chance to get an interview by 13%. It is proven with [data](https://talent.works/blog/2017/10/19/youre-5x-more-likely-to-get-job-interview-if-you-apply-by-10am/). Whatever you do, donâ€™t apply after 4pm.
