# Apply for jobs

* Group the companies that you want to work for

First let's make a list of companies you want to work for and group them in A, B, C. Write down the most wanted
companies in the group A. For example: FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google) are definitely in it. Put the
okay companies in the group B. Least desired companies will be in the group C.

Start submitting your applications from the group C. Because you need interview experiences due to prepare
yourself for the big companies. You will find your mistakes and fix them along the way.

* Create your
* Submitting application

Writing a good Cover Letter and editing your Resume takes time. So submit no more or less than 5 companies per
day. I will explain it end of this paragraph. BTW, I'm not counting here LinkedIn Easy Apply because it doesn't take time.

Countless times I met with HR managers from big FAANGS and Startups at Meetups in San Francisco. 80% of them mentioned that they don't read the Cover Letters. However, rest of 20% who reads them may give the chance for 
a candidate to get an invitation for the interview even though he/she is not qualified. It won't help if you are just using a template for your Cover Letter and changing the Company name and job title in each time. Your Cover Letter must be outstanding. You have to explain that what makes you interested in apply for this specific role and what can you bring to the table clearly on your Cover Letter. HERE IS A LINK.
Personally, I prefer to submit my Resume attach with my Cover Letter.

* The best time to apply and how much time you need to spend
It matters when you send your application. The best time is between 6am - 10am every week days. It will increase your chance to get an interview by 13%. It is proven with [data](https://talent.works/blog/2017/10/19/youre-5x-more-likely-to-get-job-interview-if-you-apply-by-10am/). Whatever you do, donâ€™t apply after 4pm.
